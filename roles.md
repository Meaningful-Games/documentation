# Roles

## Artist
Handles concept art, character designs, backgrounds, textures, fonts, and all other visual artifacts required. Assists writers with storyboarding.

## Writer
Develops plot, character backgrounds, narration, and dialog trees. Works with artists for storyboarding.

## Programmer
People that make the game go brrrr. Also until IT becomes a thing, these are the best people to come to for help with whatever program/site/app you're working with as well as requests for new integrations between products.

## Facilitator
Keeps things moving. Scans the chats for issues that need to be discussed and voted on. Makes announcements to keep everyone updated. Documents things that need to be referred to. Basically the GOAT.

## Finance
Makes sure we all get paid and all info legally required gets reported as such. When we start needing to buy things these people will handle purchase orders/subscriptions/licenses.

## Community Manager
Originally envisioned as someone to manage the Discord work with customers/fans in the forums + some things that Facilitator has wound up doing. This will probably need to be trimmed to just the forum stuff and rolled into a social media position.

## Tester
You test the games. Just about all of us are going to be doing this in some capacity, but these are the professionals.

## Designer
You know that game theory is not just a YouTube channel. You envision the systems that make the game work and keep players engaged. You'll work with the Programmers to implement these systems and Writers to make the systems make sense in the game world.

## Audio
You make the theme songs, background music, sound effects, voiceovers, and anything else that can be heard in the game.

## Legal
You make sure we're following the law. Whether that's reviewing licenses for things the Programmers want to use, making sure we're not using copyrightted music/images, or helping us file our taxes. You make sure we can keep doing what we're doing.

## Documentation
Probably redundant since Facilitator became a thing, but we'll always need documentation so we'll see if there's enough for this to be a role in and of itself.

## Missing
### Marketing
Could also be a part of a Social Media role.

### Business
These people know how to run a business that doesn't go bankrupt. They know about economics and can point us towards areas we can expand. They'll help us network, raise funding, organize ourselves better, and continue to exist.
