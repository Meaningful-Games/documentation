[DRAFT]

# The Basics
All decisions will be made by consensus as defined in the <a href="https://github.com/game-workers-cooperative/documentation/blob/main/bylaws.md">bylaws</a>. You will be part of at least one role-based team. Each team will have a leader and the leaders will collaborate to determine project goals and progress. These processes are elaborated on in the bylaws. Team leaders will be full members and not probationary members.

# Prospective Member Expectations

You will be held to these standards:
* Show up for 75% of weekly meetings. If you cannot make it to the meeting, you must watch the recording before the next meeting is held.
* Participate in Discord. Contribute on a relatively frequent basis (3+ days a week) to channels relating to your role and preferably to discussion channels as well.
* Meaningfully contribute to the tasks assigned to your role. Use Trello. Add tasks, comment on them, assign yourself to things, and usher them through the system.
* Participate in 75% of votes.

* Participate in 100% of votes.
* Provide consistent office hours. Share your hours with the rest of the members and inform everyone if they will change for any reason.

# Intellectual Property
Everything you create will be owned by the group until incorporation whereby ownership will be transferred to the company. After a period of time, the intellectual property may be open sourced.

# Incorporation Process
Right now we are not incorporated and as such, no one will be paid for any work done before the point at which we have funding. In this period the **Prospective Member Expectations** will be in effect. After incorporation we will find funding and then pay an equitable salary in a manner informed by the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VYd17AUt7BXpPfQFb-d1cqhbCioTtECWk2upcQZ8Esw/edit">AORTA fair payment process</a>. You will also then be held to the **Member Expectations**.

Failure to abide by the expectations will result in a warning and then an official vote for removal.
