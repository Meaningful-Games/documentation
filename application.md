# Membership Application

## Requirements

### Demonstration of Skills

For this requirement, you can choose to provide a portfolio of your work or we can assign you a theme and you'll be given one week to present a game to us.

If you choose to create a game, we know that the time limit will not allow you to create a masterpiece, but we do expect you highlight your skills and be able to present the game to us. The code should be made publicly available for review and we should be provided with a link to it.

### Expectation Agreement

You will be held to these standards:
* Show up for 75% of weekly meetings. If you cannot make it to the meeting, you must watch the recording before the next meeting is held.
* Participate in Discord. Contribute on a relatively frequent basis (3+ days a week) to channels relating to your role and preferably to discussion channels as well.
* Contribute meaningfully to the work assigned to your particular role. Use Trello. Add tasks, comment on them, assign yourself to things, and usher them through the system.
* Participate in 75% of votes.

Failure to do so will result in a warning and then an official vote for removal.
