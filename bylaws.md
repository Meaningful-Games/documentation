Major decisions affecting everyone will be decided by consensus:

# Consensus

Decisions that affect the group collectively must be agreed on by all members.

* **Values** The consensus process emphasizes listening, empathy, creativity, and a 
refusal to allow a majority to overrun a minority. Although group 
decisions must be made together, the process also honors participants' 
autonomy in all other matters.
* **Membership** New participants may join as long as no existing participants object.
    * **Exclusion** Participants may be removed if a proposal to do so passes the consensus process of all other participants.
* **Consensus** The consensus process proceeds as follows. Any participant may make a 
proposal for a decision at any group meeting open to which all 
participants are invited. Once stated, the proposal may be discussed, 
and the proposer may accept others' amendments. The proposal passes if 
all participants present either move to approve it or abstain from doing
 so. If a participant holds a serious concern—one that they believe 
threatens the basic values or integrity of the group—they may block it, 
and it does not pass.
    * **Executive** Unless otherwise stated, the proposer is responsible for leading the implementation of their proposal.
* **Delegation** The group can create roles, attach participants to them, and assign them authority over specified sub-domains.
* **Evolution** The group may modify this Rule through the consensus process.

Day-to-day work will follow the circle method:

# Circles

Activities are carried out through individual Roles and small groups called Circles, which have the ability to decide and act on matters in their domain. Representatives of Circles meet in a Council to coordinate efforts and determine the domains of each Circle.

* **Council**  In a Council, changes may be made by consent over the Circles' domains.
    * **Representation** Each Circle should have one Role that represents it on the 
Council. Circles should rotate their representative to the Council at each 
Council meeting so that every member of the Circle has an equal 
opportunity to participate.
    * **Fact-finding** The Council should evaluate the Circles within it.
* **Circles** Circles may be self-organized among members, provided they do not overlap with the domains of other Circles. 
    * **Membership** To join the community, a person must request membership in a particular 
Circle, and the Circle's members can respond as they see fit.
    * **Delegation** By consent, Circles may also establish Role over specified sub-domains, modify them, and appoint members to them. The Circle can create Roles and assign them authority over specified 
sub-domains. Members can hold more than one Role within or across Circles. Role-holders are understood to have authority over their Roles' 
sub-domains, but they are expected to consult with anyone affected by 
their decisions.
    * **Consensus** Policies are determined by consent within the Circle assigned to the 
relevant domain. Consent means that no more than one-tenth of the 
relevant group presents a serious objection to a policy. 
    * **Executive** Circles, as well as individual Role-holders, are responsible for 
implementing the decisions they make over their respective domains.
    * **Fact-finding** Circles should evaluate the actions of the Role-holders within them.
* **Do-ocracy** The purpose of this structure is to empower individuals and small groups
 to act in their domains of expertise in ways that are accountable to 
the larger group.
* **Ritual** Circles and the Council should establish regular meetings at which they 
coordinate their activities and adjudicate conflicts over domains.
